## Specification
### Web Architecture
Describe here, with a diagram, the components of your web application and how
they interact. Highlight which parts belong to the application layer, data layer
or presentation layer. How did you ensure that HTML is not rendered server side?

### API
#### REST compliance
Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are the
reasons for which you might have decided to diverge. Note, you must not describe
the whole API here, just the design decisions.

#### OpenAPI Resource models
Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for resources.

### Data model
Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web
application. How these map to the OpenAPI data model?

## Implementation
### Tools used
Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the backend
of the application.
To develop the back end application, we used:
- nodejs and connectjs
- postgreSQL to manage the database
- Swagger (OpenAPI) to generate and manage the server and the specification


### Discussion

- How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided OpenAPI
specification?

We actually started from the OpenAPI specification to build the project, and during the process of building the web application, we changed and manipulated the specification in order to keep it updated and coherent with the state of our project. Almost every API operation is used from the front end side, and if not, either the operation can be used to add data to the database or to supply data to other operations. Moreover, those few operations that aren't used from the front-end side could be used to expand the application anytime.


- Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to partition
the web application (static assets vs. application data)

We think that our web application adheres to common practices to partition the web application because we effectively separated the static resources, such as html, css and js files putting them on the server, from the data, that are stored in a remote database and that are reached through specific calls. As we learnt, to find the right balance between Static Content and Dynamic Content is a constant debate, but we are confident that our solution is reliable, stable and scalable.


- Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state, what are the
state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login etc..).

For the session state, we only used cookie-session and cookie-parser, as recommended during the lectures. Basically, everytime that a new agent connects to the site, a new session and session ID is generated for him. As soon as the client registers (through /user/register POST) or logins (/user/login POST) successfully, session.loggedin is setted to true and a couple session.id-username is created in the database (or updated, if another one was already there). Later on, every time that an action that needs the authentication is performed from the client, the server checks if the session.loggedin is true. If so, he looks in the database for the username corresponding to the session id, and perform any action related to him.


- Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for managing
the data model?
We used PostgreSQL for managing the data model, which refers to a relational technology.


### Task assignment

The work has been fairly subdivided between us:
- Daniele Chiappalupi worked on front end (25% of the time) and on the back end (75% of the time).
- Elena Iannucci worked on front end (75% of the time) and on the back end (25% of the time).

### Analysis of existing API
Describe here if you have found relevant APIs that have inspired the OpenAPI specification and why (at least two).

### Learning outcome
What was the most important thing all the members have learned while developing
this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered, how you will use
what you've learned in your everyday life?

- Daniele Chiappalupi has become highly confident with javascript: he never had experienced it before and he is satisfied to have broaden his skills. Moreover, he learnt to write in HTML and CSS, and has improved his version commit system knowledge. Overall, he is happy for what he has learned: developing and managind a web database is a skill that will help him in his future.

- Elena Iannucci has mastered the skills of front end developing and learned the basic functioning of database management from js. She is truly happy about what she has learnt: design, web and front end developing has always been a passion of her, and she is utterly satisfied that she had the possibility to learn them in a University course.
