      plot: "Comici Spaventati Guerrieri is a metropolitan \"recherche\", narrated as a blues that rythms movements and placements, separations and meetings, walks and runs, kung-fu fights and shots, sudden loves and sudden friendships, dialogues and monologues, visions and dreams. It remarks the infinite distance between center and outskirt. This is a novel that underlines the cynicism, the golden corruption and the lack of intelligence that rules nowadays."
