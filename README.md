## Project Description

This was a course project of [Hypermedia Applications (Web and Multimedia)](https://www4.ceda.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ManifestoPublic.do?EVN_DETTAGLIO_RIGA_MANIFESTO=evento&aa=2018&k_cf=225&k_corso_la=358&k_indir=II3&codDescr=089318&lang=IT&semestre=2&idGruppo=3800&idRiga=229375). The aim of it was building a working [website of a fictional bookshop](https://hyp-2019-chiappalupi-iannucci.herokuapp.com/). 
The functionalities that the website should have provided included the registration of an user, and the purchasing of books.

## Hidden Backdoor

The website also contains a hidden part not related to the bookshop. We added that hidden part to implement a secret-santa game between friends.

## Documentation

A full documentation of the project is available both in [pdf](https://hyp-2019-chiappalupi-iannucci.herokuapp.com/documentation.pdf) and in [html](https://hyp-2019-chiappalupi-iannucci.herokuapp.com/main.html).

## Web Documentation

An online documentation of the queries and operation available can be accessed [here](http://hyp-2019-chiappalupi-iannucci.herokuapp.com/docs/). The documentation also includes sample queries, inputs and outputs.
Note that, the hidden secret santa queries are not documented.

## Task Assignment

[Elena Iannucci](https://github.com/eleiannu) mainly worked on the *front end*, whereas [Daniele Chiappalupi](https://github.com/daniCh8) focused on the *back end*.

## Side Note

This was a course project, and it happened to be in conjunction with other two more important projects (two bachelor thesis assignments). Therefore, even though the outcome of the website has been satisfactory, many parts of code could have been cleaner, and both me and Elena acknowledge this. Maybe we will refactor it some time in the future.
